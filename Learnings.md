## I have been introduced to the below key learnings


##SDLC FUNDAMENTALS
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) refers to a methodology with clearly defined processes for creating high-quality software. in detail, the SDLC methodology focuses on the following phases of software development:
Requirement analysis
Planning
Software design such as architectural design
Software development
Testing
Deployment

##TYPES OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT
- Waterfall Project Management
- Agile Project Management

##HTML BASICS
All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>.
The HTML document itself begins with <html> and ends with </html>.
The visible part of the HTML document is between <body> and </body>.

##GITHUB 
Developers use specific commands to copy, create, change, and combine code. These commands can be executed directly from the command line or by using an application like GitHub Desktop. Here are some common commands for using Git:

git init initializes a brand new Git repository and begins tracking an existing directory. It adds a hidden subfolder within the existing directory that houses the internal data structure required for version control.

git clone creates a local copy of a project that already exists remotely. The clone includes all the project's files, history, and branches.

git add stages a change. Git tracks changes to a developer's codebase, but it's necessary to stage and take a snapshot of the changes to include them in the project's history. This command performs staging, the first part of that two-step process. Any changes that are staged will become a part of the next snapshot and a part of the project's history. Staging and committing separately gives developers complete control over the history of their project without changing how they code and work.

git commit saves the snapshot to the project history and completes the change-tracking process. In short, a commit functions like taking a photo. Anything that's been staged with git add will become a part of the snapshot with git commit.

git status shows the status of changes as untracked, modified, or staged.

git branch shows the branches being worked on locally.

git merge merges lines of development together. This command is typically used to combine changes made on two distinct branches. For example, a developer would merge when they want to combine changes from a feature branch into the main branch for deployment.

git pull updates the local line of development with updates from its remote counterpart. Developers use this command if a teammate has made commits to a branch on a remote, and they would like to reflect those changes in their local environment.

git push updates the remote repository with any commits made locally to a branch.

##CAREER ASPIRATIONS
After course completion - I will become a full stack developer and aim to work in the field of Science and technology. During this course I wish to master the fundamentals, master the key languages and develop my skills.

##AREAS OF DEVELOPMENT
I am still a little confused about terminal and push/pull requests, branching, comitting but will be able to grasp this as time goes by
